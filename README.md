# Analysis-of-Social-Media-s-Impact-on-Suicide-Rates-From-2010-2019
This project analyzed the impact of social media growth on suicide rates from 2010 to 2019, focusing on demographic trends and platform usage. The analysis uncovered patterns in suicide rate changes alongside Facebook and Twitter user growth over the decade.

The following insights were uncovered from the analysis:

**KEY INSIGHTS**

The highest percentage change in suicide rates occurred from 2010 to 2012, while Facebook and Twitter user growth was modest during this period.

Males, females, and other genders (BTSX) display near-equal social media usage growth, reflecting balanced gender representation online.

Twitter user count experienced the most significant growth between 2016 and 2019, which also marks the steepest decline in suicide rates.

Despite an overall decline in suicide rates, the average rate change is still high, indicating ongoing challenges.

The decrease in suicide rates correlates with an increase in social media user engagement over time, suggesting potential opportunities for awareness campaigns.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Investigate historical societal factors during this time to understand the spike in suicide rates and consider incorporating lessons into mental health policies.

Tailor mental health resources on social media to ensure inclusivity across all genders for maximum outreach.

Explore partnerships with Twitter to promote positive mental health campaigns based on their platform's content trends and engagement.

Strengthen public health systems and expand access to counseling services, especially in regions showing less progress.

Develop mental health programs that use engaging content on social media platforms, focusing on awareness, crisis support, and community-building efforts.
